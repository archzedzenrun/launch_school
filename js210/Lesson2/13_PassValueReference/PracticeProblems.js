// Problem 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------

// On line 7 myWord is passed to the changeMyWord function as an argument which outputs 'Hello' on line 2

// Line 8 outputs the value of myWord which is still 'Hello'

// Problem 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------

// On line 8 myWord is passed to the changeMyWord function as an argument which outputs 'Hello' on line 2. Local variable word is then reassigned to the same value but uppercase which is what the function returns. Variable myWord is reassigned to 'HELLO' which is what is output on line 9.

// Problem 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------

// On line 7 myWord variable is declared and assigned to the string 'Hello'. On line 8 myOtherWord variable is declared and assigned to the return value of passing the myWord variable as an argument to the changeMyWord function. Line 2 logs the argument ('Hello') and the function returns an uppercase version of the argument. Line 8 outputs 'Hello'. Line 9 outputs 'Hello'. Line 10 outputs 'HELLO'.

// Problem 4 ------------------------------------------------------------------

// On line 6 myWords is declared and assigned to an array object which is passed as an argument to changeMyWords function on line 7. Line 2 logs ['Hello', 'Goodbye'] and line 3 mutates the argument by setting the first element to 'Hi'. Line 8 logs ['Hi', 'Goodbye'].

// Problem 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------

// On line 7 the myWords array is passed as an argument to the changeMyWords function where it is logged on line 2 ['Hello', 'Goodbye']. Line 8 also logs ['Hello', 'Goodbye']. The myWords array is not affected by line 3 since reassignment is non-mutating.
